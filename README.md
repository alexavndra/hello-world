# hello-world
This is a COGS 108 d1 test assignment, so I'm just doing the **most random** things on this!

## This is a random second header!
I really like *Italian* food. Get it because it's italics and Italian? 


Here's the best Italian foods I've had:
1. Gelato
2. Prosciutto di Parma
3. Pizza
4. Pasta alle Vongole
5. Ravioli


Looking for a good blockquote? Here's one I think.
> Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
*â€“Edsger Dijkstra*

### Third time's the charm here!
I listen to a lot of music, but here's my top artists (not in order)
- SZA
- Megan Thee Stallion
- Beabadoobee
- Kendrick Lamar
- STAYC
- New Jeans


If I had to make a code block for printing this list out, it'd go something like this:
`artists = ['SZA', 'Megan Thee Stallion', 'Beabadoobee', 'Kendrick Lamar', 'STAYC', 'New Jeans']
  for artist in artists:
    print(artist)`


Hmm...I think I've finished the basics of Markdown here. I'm going to plug my [GitHub](https://github.com/alexavndra)
